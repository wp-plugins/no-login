Skip the login form and always auth as admin. FOR TEST SITES.

== Description ==

Skip the login form: every visitor automatically auths as an admin. FOR 'LOCALHOST' TEST SITES only, obviously, like when designing a plugin or a theme and testing it across various browsers.

For a hassle free integration, drop the plugin file into `wp-content/mu-plugins` (create the directory if needed) and it will be automatically activated.

For live blogs, see [Always Remember Me](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/always-remember-me/)

== Screenshots ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Refer to the official plugin page for documentation, usage and tips
